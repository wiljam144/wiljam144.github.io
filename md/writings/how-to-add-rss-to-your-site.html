<h1>How to Add RSS to Your Website</h1>
<h2>What is RSS (Under The Hood)</h2>
<p>I do not want to pad this text with useless information
you probably already know about. I am going to assume that 
if you clicked on this article,
there is a really high chance that you know what RSS is, and maybe even used it.
Because of that I am going to tell you about what RSS is under the hood.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> stands for
Really Simple Syndication, which unsirprisingly does not tell anything. So let me explain,
RSS under the hood is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> file with specific tags.
There are two major RSS formats that are used,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)">Atom</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS#Variants">RSS 2.0</a>.
Both are recognized and processed
by most RSS readers but in my expierence Atom is probably more modern and simple,
and that's the format I'm going to try to explain.</p>
