# How to Add RSS to Your Website

## What is RSS (Under The Hood)

I do not want to pad this text with useless information
you probably already know about. I am going to assume that 
if you clicked on this article,
there is a really high chance that you know what RSS is, and maybe even used it.
Because of that I am going to tell you about what RSS is under the hood.
[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) stands for
Really Simple Syndication, which unsirprisingly does not tell anything. So let me explain,
RSS under the hood is an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) file with specific tags.
There are two major RSS formats that are used,
[Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)) and
[RSS 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS#Variants).
Both are recognized and processed
by most RSS readers but in my expierence Atom is probably more modern and simple,
and that's the format I'm going to try to explain.
